# Implementation Guide for Fixing the Issues

This guide outlines the steps needed to fix the issues in your FastAPI application:

## 1. Install Required Dependencies

First, install the missing dependencies:

```bash
pip install pymongo pydantic-settings
```

## 2. Update the Files

Replace the following files with the fixed versions:

- `app/services/memory.py`: Fix the NoneType logger issue
- `app/api/routes.py`: Fix the dependency on RAGMemory
- `app/services/tools.py`: Add proper implementation for save_state and load_state methods

## 3. Key Changes Made

### Fixed memory.py:
- Removed dependency on `global_logger` and replaced it with a proper logger instance
- Improved error handling to prevent NoneType errors

### Fixed routes.py:
- Added proper error handling for service initialization
- Modified the `/tools` endpoint to use the Pydantic model correctly
- Ensured `tool_registry.save_state()` is called after any tool modification

### Added implementation for tools.py:
- Implemented `save_state()` and `load_state()` methods to persist tool registry state
- Used JSON file to store the tool registry configuration

## 4. Restart the Server

After making these changes, restart your server:

```bash
python run.py
```

## 5. Verify the Changes

Check that the application starts without errors and that you can interact with the API endpoints.

## Additional Improvements

1. Consider adding a proper database implementation for tool persistence rather than using a JSON file
2. Implement more robust error handling throughout the application
3. Add unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected
